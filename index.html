<strong>Hashgrab</strong> is a company that wants to innovate its financial experience using information technology.
In particular, <u>we want to help investors</u> make easy and good investments that are difficult to access.
First of all, I would like to propose a sound (optimal) investment method for P2P financial products based on the experience of the P2P financial market.

P2P finance provides alternative financial services that existing financial institutions cannot provide, and the growth continues.
<br>
<p>Hashgrab was founded by the members who have successfully managed the P2P financing in Korea, and is going to enter the major P2P finance market all over the world through the beta service in the Korean market.</p>
<p style="margin-top:50px;">Due to the nature of finance where trust is important, unverified persons or corporations are not easy to finance from existing financial institutions.</p>
Investors also have limited access to investment products.
P2P finance aims to connect borrowers and investors around the world through innovation through technology.
